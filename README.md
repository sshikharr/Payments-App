## Built a basic version of Payments App

- In this project I have built a basic payments app.
- I have used the following technologies to do so:-
1. Express JS to write the backend
2. React JS to write the frontend and do the state management.
3. I have used mongo db as the database for this application
4. I have used Node.js as the runtime.
5. Used Tailwind CSS for styling.
6. Used Axios library to make the frontend call backend for data.

## Backend 

# Authorization
- I have written proper authorization logic using an Authorization Middleware.
- Used Json Web Tokens to authorize users.

# Database
- Used MongoDB as the database.
- Used the mongoose library to access the database from the backend.

# Routes
- Creates two seperate route folders, one for the users and second for the account.
- Connected the accounts to users by refrencing.

# Input Validation
- Used the Zod library for input validation.

## Backend

# React
- Used the react library to write frontend components.
- Used the useState hook for state management.

# Axios
- Used the axios hook to let the frontend call the bckend.

# Tailwind
- Used tailwind as the styling library.
- Made decent responsive designs.
